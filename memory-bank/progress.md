# Progress — Loofi Fedora Tweaks

## What Works

### Application

- 28 feature tabs across 8 categories (System, Packages, Hardware, Network, Security, Appearance, Tools, Maintenance)
- 4 entry modes: GUI, CLI (`--cli`), Daemon (`--daemon`), API (`--api`)
- Lazy tab loading for fast startup
- Plugin marketplace with sandboxing, ratings, reviews, hot-reload
- Experience levels (Beginner/Intermediate/Expert)
- Guided tour and onboarding wizard
- Health score dashboard with timeline and diagnostics
- Abyss (dark) and Light themes
- Command palette for quick actions
- Dangerous operation confirmation dialogs with safety snapshots
- Ansible export, kickstart generation, report export
- AI agent runtime with planning and scheduling

### Infrastructure

- 228+ test files, 6383+ tests, 81%+ coverage (80% CI-enforced)
- RPM packaging via COPR (`multidraxter-bit/loofi-fedora-tweaks`)
- Flatpak and AppImage distribution
- Systemd service for daemon mode
- Polkit policy for privilege escalation
- CI pipeline with coverage gate, stabilization rules, docs gate, bandit security scanner
- Structured service layer (9 domains) + core layer (8 domains)
- All 6 stabilization/hardening phases complete

### Version History Summary

- SemVer: v2.0.0 "Evolution" — service layer migration
- SemVer: v2.1.0 "Continuity" — workflow realignment and adapter sync
- SemVer: v2.2.0 "Velocity" — performance caching and subprocess safety
- SemVer: v2.2.1 (patch) — CI @patch target corrections
- SemVer: v2.2.2 (patch) — CI coverage threshold and tasks spec gate
- SemVer: v2.3.0 "Insight" — diagnostics expansion
- SemVer: v2.4.0 "Evolution" — daemon foundation + IPC fallback alignment
- SemVer: v2.5.0 "API Slice 1" — network/firewall API migration
- SemVer: v2.6.0 "API Slice 2" — package API migration
- SemVer: v2.7.0 "API Slice 3" — system-service API migration + Phase 3 prep
- SemVer: v2.8.0 "API Slice 4" — policy inventory execution + validator hardening (released)

Current active semantic cycle: v2.10.0 (active).

## Current Status

**v2.10.0 "API Migration Slice 6 (Canonical Workflow + Next Migration Kickoff)"**: 🔄 ACTIVE — canonical workflow tag normalization + next migration target planning.

**v2.9.0 "API Migration Slice 5 (Residual Privileged Path Migration)"**: ✅ COMPLETE — workflow tasks and release phases complete; metadata moved to DONE state.

### v2.9.0 Implementation Snapshot (2026-02-26)

- `TASK002` inventory completed with residual migration targets and implementation priority.
- Daemon interface expanded in `daemon/server.py` with `Package*`, `System*`, and `Service*` method exposure.
- `ServiceHandler` expanded with `mask_unit`, `unmask_unit`, and `get_unit_status` wrapper methods.
- `ServiceManager` daemon-first migration started for list/start/stop/restart/mask/unmask/status pathways.
- `FirewallManager.is_running()` migrated to daemon-first mode with local-safe fallback behavior.
- `PortAuditor` local fallback paths now validate/normalize `port` + `protocol` inputs before daemon/local execution.
- `TASK003` and `TASK004` completed for selected residual migration targets with daemon handler/service parity in place.
- Focused regression verification passed (`248 passed`, `0 failed`) across daemon client/fallback/firewall/ports/system focused suites.
- Documentation synchronization completed (`CHANGELOG`, `README`, `RELEASE-NOTES-v2.9.0`) and release-doc validation passed.

**v2.8.0 "API Migration Slice 4 (Policy & Validator Hardening)"**: ✅ COMPLETE — plan/design/build/test/document/package/release phases complete.

**v2.7.0 "API Migration Slice 3 (System Services)"**: ✅ COMPLETE — plan, design, build, test, document, package, and release phases complete.
**v2.6.0 "API Migration Slice 2 (Packages)"**: ✅ COMPLETE — package API daemon-first migration.
**v2.5.0 "API Migration Slice 1"**: ✅ COMPLETE — network/firewall daemon-first migration.
**v2.4.0 "Evolution"**: ✅ COMPLETE — daemon foundation and hardening alignment.
**v2.3.0 "Insight"**: ✅ COMPLETE — diagnostics expansion.

**Project state**: Stable with v2.9.0 closed and v2.10.0 active for bounded workflow normalization and next migration planning.

### v2.8.0 Verification Snapshot (2026-02-26)

- Targeted hardening suite passed: 98 tests (`validators`, daemon handlers, IPC fallback/types, daemon dbus/client pathways)
- Targeted coverage reached 91% across hardened modules (`daemon.validators`, selected daemon handlers, `services.ipc.types`)
- Last full-repo local coverage gate remained below threshold (78.02% vs 80% target)

### v2.8.0 Package Attempt Snapshot (2026-02-26)

- P6 preflight checks passed locally: version alignment (`version.py` and spec both `2.8.0`), lint pass, full test pass (`7152 passed`, `116 skipped`)
- Initial host execution was blocked by local prerequisites (`rpmbuild`, Python `build` module)
- Re-executed packaging in Docker Fedora environment (`fedora:41`) with required build dependencies installed
- Successful package outputs:
  - `rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/loofi-fedora-tweaks-2.8.0-1.fc41.noarch.rpm`
  - `dist/loofi_fedora_tweaks-2.8.0.tar.gz`
- Workflow/report outputs generated successfully (`.workflow/reports/test-results-v2.8.0.json`, `.workflow/reports/run-manifest-v2.8.0.json`, `.project-stats.json`)

### v2.8.0 Release Closure Snapshot (2026-02-26)

- `P7 RELEASE` marked successful in `.workflow/reports/run-manifest-v2.8.0.json`
- `ROADMAP.md` updated from `[ACTIVE]` to `[DONE]` for v2.8.0
- Memory-bank state synchronized to completed v2.8.0 cycle

## Known Issues

- Local pytest may warn about unknown `timeout` option when `pytest-timeout` plugin is unavailable in the current environment.
